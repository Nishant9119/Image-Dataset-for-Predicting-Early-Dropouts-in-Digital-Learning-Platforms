# Image-Dataset-for-Predicting-Early-Dropouts-in-Digital-Learning-Platforms
#Abstract
This article presents a student click-stream database comprising of 120542
train images and 80362 test images where each directory contains two sub
directories i.e. ”Dropouts” and ”NonDropouts” as two different classes.The
original dataset was provided by KDD Cup Challenge 2015 in which the
dataset was provided by chinese MOOC(Massive open online course) plat-
form XuetangX. These samples have been acquired or captured through the
clickstream activity/user activity on the platform. We transformed the KDD-
Cup 2015 dataset into an image dataset. This transformation will enable the
application of novel deep learning and computer vision techniques to develop
more sustainable, accurate, and robust predictive models for identifying stu-
dents at risk of dropping out and will enable MOOC platforms to design
highly robust Early Warning Systems. Furthermore, this dataset will be
made publicly available to the research community to advance interdisci-
plinary research at the intersection of education and computer vision.
